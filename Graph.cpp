//  ######## GRAPH #################
// Graph is the nonlinear data Structure with consisting vertices and nodes

// Every node in Graph has unique node 
// It is the collection of vertices and node G={V,E}
// It is use in Networking model 
// Graph may be cyclic or acyclic
// Every Acyclic Graph is a tree 
// No. od edges in graph may be less or equal or more than vertices
