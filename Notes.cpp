// Stack and heap is memory
// Constant value are negligible for complexity



  // Insertion Sort is Stable sorting algorithm  
//  It is also Inplace 
// Time Complexity O(n)
// Space Complexity is O(n) 

// here while loop is used instead of if because if check only once at a time
// Why minimum value is greater than zero index
// because it start from one index

// #################
// Only selection sort has time complexity for all cases
// Time  Complexity
//Best  Case : O(n)
//Average Case : O(n)
//Worst Case : O(n)

// Bubble , Selection and Insertion are the time taken algorithms

////  QUICK SORTING 
// It is mostly useful sorting algorithm 
// It follow Divide and conquer approach 
// It use pivot element 
// It divide array in two part may be or not
// It also use Recurssion 
//It is not mandatory to select the pivot element is always first element  
// It use two pointer

// ######## RECURSION ######## 
// It is define as the function calling it self 
// It has two parameter 1 base condition 2 recursion relationship

// every time recursion program will be create parameterized function   

// Type of recursion 
// Head Recursion and Tail Recursion 
//  If function call before print in recursion it is called Tail recursion
//  If function call After print in recursion it is called Head recursion


////   LOGIC of Quick Sort 

//choose first element as a pivot 
// then after pivot element first element as P and last element is Q
// if P > Pivot then
//    stop
// else
//    P++
// and
// if Q < Pivot then 
//    stop
// else
//    Q--


// If two pointer are not cross each other then swap is done between two pointer 
// and  if two pointer are cross each other then swap is done between 
// last pointer Q  and pivot element and mid value is obtained
