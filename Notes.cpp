// Stack and heap is memory
// Constant value are negligible for complexity



  // Insertion Sort is Stable sorting algorithm  
//  It is also Inplace 
// Time Complexity O(n)
// Space Complexity is O(n) 

// here while loop is used instead of if because if check only once at a time
// Why minimum value is greater than zero index
// because it start from one index

// #################
// Only selection sort has time complexity for all cases
//Best  Case : O(n)
//Average Case : O(n)
//Worst Case : O(n)
